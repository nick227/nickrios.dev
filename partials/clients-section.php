			<p class="white small nomargin">I was the first developer brought onto our core product. And deployed the prototype that helped get the project funded. We ramped up eventually to eight developers. This was an Angular/Pug/Grunt front-end built on load-balanced node.js/Express API.</p><div class="spacer-10px"></div><p class="white small">We used an ElasticSeach cluster as our single-point-of-truth and managed object relationships in neo4j and Karma/Jasmine for testing. Besides offering custom UI based on support engineer interviews we provided uniquely powerful search capabilities. After launch we extended our data service for various teams and reporting systems and contributed Angular components to the national Cisco repository.</p><div class="spacer-10px"></div>

				<p class="white small">During my years with MultiView I worked on dozens of projects. However the key things I learned were fast-paced sales culture and fundamental principals of design. I was hired by the design team specifically to be more agile than going through IT. As a result we would brainstorm a concept at 8:00 AM and be pushing to production later that afternoon.
					<p class="white small">
					I lent my skills to every department in the company. Working on a wide-range of challenges from data scraping and delivering internal tools to a YouTube miniseries, a Caribbean homes website and a streaming-media service. Our core business was selling digital ads that I would implement on partner websites. Giving me exposure to dozens of association homepages.</p>
